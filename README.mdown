# rmate

If you wish to activate TextMate from an ssh session you can do so by copying the `rmate` (ruby) script to the server you are logged into. The script will connect back to TextMate running on your Mac so you should setup an ssh tunnel (as your Mac is likely behind NAT):

	ssh -R 52698:127.0.0.1:52698 user@example.org

# Install

You can install `rmate` via `gem`:
  
	gem install specific_install
	gem specific_install -l https://github.com/lvpython/rmate.git
  

# Usage
	rmate .
Edit all file under pwd current directory.

	rmate [options] file

Call `rmate --help` for a list of options. Default options can be set in `/etc/rmate.rc` or `~/.rmate.rc`, e.g.:

	host: auto  # prefer host from SSH_CONNECTION over localhost
	port: 52698

You can also set the `RMATE_HOST` and `RMATE_PORT` environment variables.
